#PASS STATEMENT:--
#The pass statement in Python is a null operation â€” when it is executed, nothing happens. It
#can be used when a statement is required syntactically but no execution of code is necessary.
#The pass statement is also used as a placeholder when a function or a code block is incomplete.

for i in range(0,645):
    pass          # because of this pass condition below write code will be executed.
                  # OTHERWISE THIS CODE WILL NOT BE EXECUTED.

    print(i)
